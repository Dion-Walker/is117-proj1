				We are non-for profit organization that intends to provide accurate historical information on computer networking and the Internet.

				Today millions of people use the Internet but many are not aware of the origin of the Internet.

				slowing the network down. To solve this problem, bridges (and their multi port relative) were introduced. What they did is learn who was connected to them and only passed 
				<br>
				data to the computers it only knew and discarded the rest. This was great since allow for faster communication but caused a new problem; a computer that is connected 
				<br>
				two switches over will not have it data sent outside its immediate area. To solve this problem routers were invented, they combined the principle of switches with addition 
				<br>
				transporting info across multiple networks. Routers and switches are the main backbone to any network, without them the network will cease to exist.
